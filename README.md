# Kukri Labs projects

Welcome to the open discussion of Kukri Labs projects.

There is no code in this repository, it purely acts as an entry point to manage and oversee the various Kukri Labs projects.

## Have an idea?

If you have a problem that you think would make a good, focused SaaS project then head on over to the ["Ideas" discussion area](https://github.com/KukriLabs/projects/discussions/categories/ideas) to submit it. We will review, discuss, vote and (hopefully) implement!
